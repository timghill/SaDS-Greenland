# SaDS modeling of supraglacial meltwater flow on the Greenland Ice Sheet
This directory contains the necessary output and data files, and Matlab plotting functions and scripts to analyze SaDs model outputs.

Matlab files are in the `analysis/` directory. Figures are saved to the `analysis/figures/` directory.

You will need the Matlab [cmoocean](https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/57773-cmocean-perceptually-uniform-colormaps) and [palettes](https://github.com/timghill/palettes) packages. Otherwise, change colormaps as required to built-in alternatives.
