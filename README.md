This directory contains the necessary output and data files, and Matlab plotting functions and scripts to analyze SaDs model outputs.

Matlab files are in the `analysis/` directory. Figures are saved to the `analysis/figures/` directory.

You will need the Matlab [cmoocean](https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/57773-cmocean-perceptually-uniform-colormaps) and [palettes](https://github.com/timghill/palettes) packages. Otherwise, change colormaps as required to built-in alternatives.
